How are we splitting epochs and batches again?

strongly depends on the model - time slices of minutes, batches might be overlapping  

Why a triangular GAN ? 

Bias in taking multiple samples on the same day ? 

According to funding proposal: 
    Quantitative measurements of non-paretic limb activity can be used to identify and categorize
    delirium phenotypes in stroke patients with a high degree of accuracy 
        Are we just looking at non-paretic limbs or comparing them to paretic limbs?
        

given age, severity, .... , what's my prior distribution for delerium 

Labels -- Sign of delerium 
Inputs -- CSV files (organized by opposite side of the stroke)
    do we want to only examine the affected side

Could you explain the differences in what we expect to see in paretic vs non-paretic? yes potentially 

Should more importance be placed on patients that have YES delerium one day and NO others

YES and NO don't seem to be random, follow blocks 

GAN - may want to generate the condition based on the other 

Lab meetings fridays at 2pm, 233 richmond 

a bunch of 

Query with query terms, 

tf*idf, bucketing, neural networks, ranking documenting, learning potential bucket positions in the distribution
datasets all out there, deep learning rankers

baseline papers shared with me from Carsten, somewhere down the line discretization

Mike - neuro 

diagnosis made in early afternoon, mike still believes days are the best label system

could we figure out when external stimulus happens, possibly when two limbs are similar?

try changing the labels so they are all the same, don't split them into distinct classes
check what reduce mean does 
potentially focuns on within patient differences



From two consecutive runs without changing anything :
---------------------------------

add gausian noise, randomize the samples

add noise according to each patient, or add noise according to the overall distribution of,
the combined patients, or add noise according to the distributions of differntly labeled 
days.
